# Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset

This folder contains files from the Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset, specifically formatted for research and analysis in urban sensing and federated learning privacy preservation. Each file represents GPS trajectory data for individual users, including latitude, longitude, and timestamp information. This dataset is useful for studies in location-based services, trajectory analysis, and privacy preservation techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The Geolife GPS Trajectory dataset captures user movements in various urban environments, providing highly detailed location traces. The data includes:

Latitude and Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the userâ€™s location.
Timestamp: Time of each GPS recording.

## Files Overview
Each user has two types of files:

User_<ID>.csv: The original dataset collected for each user, containing raw GPS data.
User_<ID>_latlontime.csv: The preprocessed dataset with structured latitude, longitude, and time columns for further analysis.
